# HighSchoolPortal
Create a folder in your computer
Clone or download the files
Copy and paste the files to the newly created folder above
cd into that folder and do npm install
cd again into client folder and do npm install

After all the dependencies have been installed, start your mongodb server on a seperate terminal
Create a database called highschooldb in your mongodb

Now, do npm run dev.. this should start both the server and the client..

Happy coding!!


Thanks.
